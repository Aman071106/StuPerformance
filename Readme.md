# **CarPrice🚗 prediction model for learning End to end ML implementation 🤖**

This project will be based on a generic ml project structure that can be used in ml/dl etc.


Steps)
# Installation types setup
1)Git{Repository} setup
    # Setting  up a new env(conda)
Note:
    If you create a conda env inside vscode inside a specific repo we will get that folder there and can see it from here but if we created the env somewhere else(generally in anaconda3/envs) then that same folder will be present there.
2)requirements.txt
3)setup.py
4)gitignore with template in github

For above process and many other such processes/steps there are also automated ways but we will learn them later first by learnign basics
